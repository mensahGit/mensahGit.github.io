<h1>Sheryl Sandberg - COO, Facebook</h1>
<p>
In June 2012, Sheryl Sandberg became the first woman to serve on Facebook’s board of directors. That same year, she made Time’s 100 Most Influential People list. Prior to her work with Facebook, Sheryl was the chief of staff for the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and was later employed at Google, serving as Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations.
She is the author of the book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, which explores themes like feminism, sexism in the workplace, and the societal/personal barriers to gender equality in the professional world. It topped bestseller lists and sold more than one million copies.

Currently, reports estimate Sandberg’s net worth, which is largely in stock holdings, at over US $1 billion.

<div class="meg">
<h1>Susan Wojcicki - CEO of Youtube</h1>
<p>
Susan earned her bachelor’s degree in history and literature at Harvard University, graduating with honors in 1990. Originally, her plan was to pursue a PhD in economics and work in academia but changed course when she became interested in technology. In 1999, she joined Google as their first marketing manager and worked her way up to senior vice president of Advertising and Commerce.

After overseeing Google Video for some time, Susan proposed that the company acquire Youtube (which at the time was a small startup). In 2006, she handled the $1.65 billion purchase. The following year, she oversaw another large acquisition: the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick.

She later handled two of Google’s largest acquisitions: the $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 and the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2007. In February 2014, Susan was appointed CEO of YouTube.

Susan often speaks about the importance of balancing family and career life, and with five children of her own, has the experience to back up her words. Like Sheryl Sandberg, she also made Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2015.

<!-- Tomoe ////////////-->
<!-- //////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<div class="meg">
<h1>Tomoe Gozen</h1>
<p>
Tomoe Gozen (1157?-1247?) was an onna-bugeisha (女武芸者, female martial artist) who served Minamoto no Yoshinaka during the Genpei War (1180-1185). Before the samurai became a formalized caste in the Edo Period (1603-1868), women were trained to use naginata spears and kaiken daggers to protect communities with few male fighters. In fact, the legendary Empress Jingu is said to have led an invasion of Korea in the year 200 after her emperor-husband was slain in battle, though whether this invasion ever actually happened remains a matter of debate.

The Genpei War was fought between the powerful Minamoto (Genji) and Taira (Heike) clans, both offshoots of the imperial line. Tomoe had a number of achievements in the war, leading 1,000 cavalry, surviving a battle of 300 against 6,000, and collecting opponents' heads like postage stamps. In The Tale of the Heike (平家物語・Heike Monogatari), an epic poem about the conflict compiled by at least 1309, it's written that in addition to Tomoe's beauty, "She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swords-woman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot."

As the Genpei War came to a close, Yoshinaka vied for power over the entire Minamoto Clan. While he was defeated by his cousin Yoritomo (who went on to found the Kamakura Shogunate), it's recorded that Tomoe unhorsed, pinned and decapitated Yoritomo's strongest warrior at the Battle of Awazu in 1184. What became of her thereafter is unclear, and the role of onna-bugeisha faded toward the Edo Period, though Tomoe reemerged as a popular figure in ukiyo-e prints and kabuki plays.

<!-- Kusunoki ////////////-->
<!-- //////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<div class="meg">
<h1>Kusunoki Masashige</h1>
<p>
Kusunoki Masashige (1294?-1336) is famous both as a military strategist and for his unfailing devotion. In 1331, he joined Emperor Go-Daigo (1288-1339) in a bid to wrest power back from the Kamakura Shogunate, under which the emperor had become a mere figurehead. Kusunoki's greatest triumph came in 1332, when he defended Chihaya Castle, located south of Osaka, against the shogunate's 100,000-man army with just 2,000 men. 

Kusunoki was given control of several parts of the Kansai area after the war was won. However, the Kenmu Restoration would be short-lived, as the Ashikaga Clan betrayed Kusunoki and twice led armies against Kyoto in 1336. On the second occasion, Kusunoki advocated letting the superior Ashikaga force take the capital while the emperor's supporters took refuge among the monks of Mount Hiei, then sweep down upon the Ashikaga and trap them in the city. Go-Daigo, however, ordered Kusunoki to advance. The seasoned strategist knew this to be a death sentence, yet he accepted. When his troops were finally overwhelmed at the Battle of Minatogawa near present-day Kobe, Kusunoki committed suicide rather than allow himself to be captured. He is now a symbol of courage and devotion to the emperor, and a statue of him stands outside Tokyo's Imperial Palace.

<!-- Sanada ////////////-->
<!-- //////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<div class="meg">
<h1>Sanada Yukimura</h1>
<p>
Hailed in his day as the greatest warrior in Japan, Sanada Yukimura (1567-1615) battled valiantly against the tumultuous beginnings of Tokugawa rule over the nation. His brilliant defense of Ueda Castle in Nagano ensured that Tokugawa Hidetada's 40,000 troops wouldn't arrive in time to support his father, Ieyasu, at the decisive Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Ieyasu won nonetheless, and though he soon claimed control over all of Japan, Yukimura led the defense in the final resistance to Tokugawa rule at the Siege of Osaka from 1614 to 1615, fighting so fiercely that he forced the superior Tokugawa forces to accept an armistice after the initial Winter Campaign. However, Ieyasu returned several months later with 150,000 men for the Summer Campaign, and while Yukimura led his own 60,000 troops bravely, he was ultimately exhausted and slain.

<!-- Yasuke ////////////-->
<!-- //////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<div class="meg">
<h1>Yasuke</h1>
<p>
Yasuke was an African slave brought to Japan in 1579 by the Jesuit missionary Alessandro Valignano. Nobody in Japan had seen a black person before, so his presence caused quite a sensation. He was called to an audience with Oda Nobunaga, the most powerful warlord of the day, who was so stunned by his appearance that he had him strip to the waist and rub his skin to prove he wasn't colored with ink.

Nobunaga was so impressed by Yasuke's strength and size—recorded as roughly 188 centimeters (6ft 2in) tall—that he made him his personal retainer and bodyguard. In 1581, Yasuke was elevated to the rank of samurai and stationed at Azuchi Castle, Nobunaga's crowning glory, where he dined with the warlord and functioned as his personal sword bearer.

When Nobunaga was betrayed by Akechi Mitsuhide and forced to commit suicide at Honno-ji Temple in 1582, Yasuke was there, and battled Mitsuhide's forces. He escaped to Azuchi Castle and briefly served Nobunaga's son until he, too, was attacked by Mitsuhide and committed suicide.

Yasuke then surrendered his sword to Mitsuhide who, unaccustomed to a samurai surrendering rather than killing himself after the death of his lord, ordered Yasuke returned to the Jesuit mission in Kyoto. Whether this was out of disrespect for a "beast," as Mitsuhide put it, or cover for an act of mercy remains a matter of debate. Thereafter, Yasuke's fate is unclear, though it's possible his presence was recorded around Kyushu in 1584.

Nobody is entirely sure where Yasuke was born, though it's been proposed he may have been from Mozambique, Angola or Ethiopia, or perhaps a European-born slave from Portugal. His real name, too, is unknown, though Yasuke is thought to be its Japanese equivalent.
